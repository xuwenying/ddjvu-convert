一、简介

ddjvu是Linux下处理djvu图片的常用命令，该命令不是linux自带的shell命令，需要额外进行安装之后才能够使用，
ddjvu主要实现djvu图片的格式装换和切割等功能。convert命令的功能更加的强大，
在linux中使用man convert来查看给命令时，它给出了这样的解释：

[plain] view plain copy print?
convert - convert between image formats as well as resize an image,   
          blur, crop, despeckle, dither, draw on, flip, join, re-sample, and much more.  
足以说明其功能的多样性，是linux下处理图片的常用工具。

二、安装

1、ddjvu的安装

     1) 下载djvulibre-x.x.x.x.tar.gz源码；

     2) 使用tar命令解压上面下载的源码；

     3) 进入解压后的目录，并运行 ./configure，如果成功则进行下一步，否则根据提示进行处理；

     4) 运行make && make install 命令(或者分开运行)

注：安装完djvulibre之后我们可以发现，系统中增加了不止ddjvu一个命令，其他命令也有很大的用处，
想djvudump命令可以方便的得到djvu图片的信息等，这些命令可以再需要的时候进行查看。

2、 convert的安装

在Redhat / Centos / Fedora中我们直接使用

yum install ImageMagick  

而在ubuntu / Debian中我们可以使用

apt-get install ImageMagick
 
在ubuntu上如果发现存在依赖包的问题，可以使用下面安装命令：

aptitude install imagemagick  
三、使用

ddjvu和convert命令的功能非常的强大，在这里直接将linux中的帮助文档贴在下面，以便查找相应的功能：

1、ddjvu

NAME
       ddjvu - Command line DjVu decoder.
SYNOPSIS
       ddjvu -format=fmt [options] [djvufile] [outputfile]
DESCRIPTION
       Decode the DjVu file djvufile, produces the image file outputfile.
       The DjVu data is read from the standard input when argument djvufile is not specified or when it is equal to a single dash.  Similarly, the output data is written to the standard output when argument outputfile is not specified or equal to a single dash.  However a valid output file name is always required when producing  a  TIFF or PDF file.
MAIN OPTIONS
       -format=fmt
              Specify the output file formats.  The recognized file formats are pbm, pgm, ppm, pnm, rle, tiff, and pdf.
              *  Formats  pbm, pgm, and ppm respectively produce a Portable Bitmap (PBM), Portable Graymap (PGM), or Portable Pixmap (PGM) file.  Format pnm produces a PBM, PGM, or PPM output file according to the color content of the output image.
              *  Format rle produces a compact run length encoded bitonal file that is understood by the DjVuLibre commands cjb2 and csepdjvu.
              *  Format tiff produces a Tagged Image Format (TIFF) file.  The resulting file uses the best available lossless compression model.  Enabling lossy  JPEG  compression (see option -quality below) often produces much smaller files.  Commands tiffcp(1) and tiffsplit(1) are useful for manipulating the resulting TIFF files.
              *  Format pdf produces a Portable Document Format (PDF) file.  Each page in the resulting file is represented by an image at the specified  resolution,  using the  best  available lossless compression model.  Enabling lossy JPEG compression (see option -quality below) often produces much smaller files.  An alternate way to produce PDF file consists in first using djvups(1) and convert the resulting PostScript file to PDF.  Which method gives better results depends on the contents of the DJVU file and on the capabilities of the PS to PDF converter.
              When  option  -format  is  not specified, the extension of argument outputfile has no influence on the default output format.  Instead the program behavior is modified to ensure backward compatibility with previous versions of ddjvu.  We recommend to always specify the output format using this option.
       -page=pagespec
              Specify which pages should be decoded.  When this option is not specified, all pages of the documents are decoded and concatenated into the output file.   The page  specification pagespec contains one or more comma-separated page ranges.A page range is either a page number,or two page numbers separated by a dash. For instance, specification 1-10 outputs pages 1 to 10, and specification 1,3,99999-4 outputs pages 1 and 3, followed by all the  document  pages  in  reverse order up to page 4.
       -mode=mod
              Selects which layers of the DjVu image should be rendered.  Valid rendering modes are color, black, mask, foreground, and background.
              *  Rendering  mode  color  is  the default mode.  When the DjVu file is bitonal, bitonal or gray-level output is produced depending on the subsampling factor. Otherwise a color image is produced.
              *  Rendering mode black is useful to extract a meaningful black and white image.  bitonal or gray-level output is produced depending on the  subsampling  factor.
              *  Rendering  modes  mask,  foreground,  and  background  select specific layers of a DjVu image.  These modes can fail if the DjVu image does not contain the selected layer.
       -skip  Instead of aborting when encountering a corrupted page, this option causes ddjvu to simply skip the corrupted page and continue with the next.  This is useful for processing certain damaged files.
RESOLUTION OPTIONS
       The following options control the resolution of the output image.  The default resolution is the native resolution of the DjVu file, equivalent to selecting -1.
       -n     Specify an integer sub-sampling factor.  The dimensions of the full output image will be n times smaller than the DjVu image size.  The legal values for argument n range from 1 to 12.  Option -1, for instance, produces an output image whose resolution is equal to the resolution of the input DjVu image file.
       -subsample=n
              This is equivalent to option -n.
       -scale=mag
              Specify a magnification factor relative to the resolution stored in the DjVu image.  Specifying magnification of 100 produces an image suitable for displaying on  a  100  dpi device such as a computer screen.  The magnification factor mag can also be interpreted as the resolution of the output image expressed in dot per inch.
       -size=wxh
              Specify the size of the full output image.  Rendering the full DjVu image would create an output image whose width and height would not exceed w  and  h.   To change the aspect ratio, you must also use option -aspect=no.
       -aspect=yesno
              This  option  indicates whether the image aspect ratio should be preserved.  The defaults is to preserve the aspect ration. This option permits changes in the aspect ratio when used in combination with option -size.
OTHER OPTIONS
       -verbose
              Display informational messages describing the structure of the DjVu image and the format of the output file.
       -segment=wxh+x+y
              Specify an image segment to render.  Program ddjvu conceptually renders the full page using the specified resolution, and then extracts a sub-image of width w and  height h, starting at position (x,y) relative to the bottom left corner of the page.  Both operations of course happen simultaneously.  Rendering a small sub-image is much faster than rendering the complete image.  The output file will always have size wxh when this option is specified.
       -quality=factor
              Enables lossy compression in TIFF and PDF files.  Without this option, TIFF or PDF output files always use lossless compression or no  compression.   Argument factor  specifies  a  JPEG  quantization factor ranging from 25 to 150. See command cjpeg(1) for more information on JPEG quantization factors.  Value 80 is a good starting point.
       -quality=uncompressed
              Completely disables compression in TIFF and PDF files.  Although the resulting files are often huge, this is sometimes useful for maximal  compatibility  with hastily written software.

DEPRECATED OPTIONS
       Various  options  have  been  maintained  to  ensure  backward compatibility with previous versions of ddjvu.  When option -format is not specified, the program only decodes the first page of the document and the default resolution becomes -scale=100.  Options -size, -scale, -segment, and -page accept an argument separated  by  a space.  Options -foreground, -background, and -black are shorthands for the -mode=mod option.  Please do not rely on these features.
EXAMPLES
       Command: ddjvu -format=tiff myfile.djvu myfile.tif
       decodes all pages and produces a multipage TIFF file.
       Command: ddjvu -format=ppm -page=1 -size=100x100 myfile.djvu -
       produces a thumbnail for the first page of a document and outputs it as a PPM file on the standard output.

       By default, the image format of `file' is determined by its magic number.  To specify a particular image format, precede the filename with an image format name and a colon (i.e. ps:image) or specify the image type as the filename suffix (i.e. image.ps).  Specify 'file' as '-' for standard input or output.
